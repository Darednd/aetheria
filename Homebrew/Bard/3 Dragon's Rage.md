3rd-level Abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30ft
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Components:** V, S

A creature you choose within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is affected by [[elemental blight]] and is enraged for the duration.

The enraged creature goes into a frenzy and always attacks the nearest creature with absolute focus. The creature also gets a bonus of 1d10 dragon damage on each damage roll it makes for any kind of attack.

Casting this spell at higher levels boosts the damage done by the enraged creature by 1d10 per level above 3rd.
