A black cloud with crackling red energy appears in the mouth of a creature you choose within range. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is considered silenced until the start of your next turn, unless it speaks Draconic. Regardless of whether it succeeds or not, the creature has disadvantage on any attack on its next turn.

If the creature speaks Draconic, any spell it casts while under the effect of this spell is amplified and is considered to be cast at one level above the spell slot used.

If a creature under the effect of this spell tries to cast a spell requiring a verbal component and does not speak Draconic, the creature becomes affected by [[elemental blight]].
