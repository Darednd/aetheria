9 A dark fog with crackling red energy spread on the ground around you in a 10ft radius. All creatures that start their turn in this fog must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is affected by [[elemental blight]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn.

The DC for the saving throw is calculated with the following formula: 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution Modifier

10 Your eyes go red and dark fog starts emanating from your body. Until the rage ends, your melee weapon attacks deal extra 1d10 dragon damage.
