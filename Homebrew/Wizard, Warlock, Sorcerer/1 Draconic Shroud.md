1st-level Abjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action (Concentration*)
**Range:** Self (Touch*)
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Components:** V, S, M (A handful of rocks, dirt or sand)

A black fog with red crackling energy surrounds your torso, giving you a +1 bonus to AC. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while the armor is active, they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is affected by [[elemental blight]].

* You can cast this spell to another creature with touch range, but then it requires concentration.

When the spell is cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the AC bonus increases by 1 for each slot level above 1st.
