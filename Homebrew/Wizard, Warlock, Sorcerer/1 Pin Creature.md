**Casting Time:** 1 Action
**Range:** 60ft
**Duration:** 1 Minute
**Components:** V, S, M (fine grained dust (can be salt, sand, flour...))

Choose a small (or smaller) creature that you can see within range and is close to a solid surface. A spectral seal attempts to pin the creature. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained for the duration. On a failed save, the target also takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

When you cast this spell at higher levels, pick one of the following effects per slot level above 1st:
- The size of the creature you can target increases by one (small -> medium -> large -> huge -> gargantuan)
- The damage the spell does increases by one die.
- The damage die of the spell increases (1d4 -> 1d8 -> 1d12)
