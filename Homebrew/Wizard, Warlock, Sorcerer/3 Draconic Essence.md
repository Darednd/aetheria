3rd-level Evocation

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
**Components:** V, S

You imbue your body with draconic energy, powering up your spellcasting for the duration. The spell can only power up spells up to the level it was cast. E.g. when cast at 3rd level, it can only power up spells cast at 3rd level or below. In order to power up higher level spells, this spell needs to be cast at a level equal to or higher than the spell that you want to power up.

Additionally, a creature damaged by a powered up spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they are affected by [[elemental blight]].

While active, the spell adds dragon damage to all damaging spells you cast. The damage depends on the dice used by the cast spell. The number of extra dice is the same as the cast spell, but the dice change by one degree.

1d4 -> 1 extra damage
1d6 -> 1d4 extra damage
1d8 -> 1d6 extra damage...

E.g. A Fireball at 3rd level, cast after casting this spell does 8d6 fire damage and 8d4 dragon damage.
