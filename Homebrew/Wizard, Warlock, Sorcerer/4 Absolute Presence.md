Your body exudes dark fumes and your eyes shine red as the raw power of the Exiled courses through you, bolstering you with ultimate confidence.

For the duration of the spell, any roll involving the Charisma stat benefits twice from your modifier for that check. E.g. if your modifier for a Persuasion (Charisma) check is +7 (CHA modifier and proficiency bonus included), while the spell is active, you get to add +14 to the roll.

The added modifier cannot be below +10. E.g. if you have +4 and would add +8, add +10 instead.

The spell cannot be dismissed at will...
