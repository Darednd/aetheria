2nd-level Conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60ft (20ft radius sphere)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
**Components:** V, S

A black fog with crackling red energy starts spreading from a point you choose within range to fill a 20ft radius sphere for the duration. The fog spreads around corners. The fog does not count as magical darkness and can be seen through by creatures with darkvision or any light source. For other purposes, creatures within the fog are considered to be in dim light.

Any creature starting its turn within the fog needs to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they are affected by [[elemental blight]] and can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn starting from their next turn.

When this spell is cast at 3rd level or higher, you can choose a number of creatures which gain elemental blight immunity from the fog. E.g. 1 creature when cast at 3rd level, 2 creatures when cast at 4th level etc.
