If two #eidolon champions, or upcoming ones, touch each other, or touch an [[Aspects of Reciprocity]] of another #eidolon, a repulsion effect activates and causes bludgeoning damage.

The damage depends on the level of reciprocity and can range between 1d6 and even 10d6 damage if a full-fledged champion touches another, or if they touch a greater [[Aspects of Reciprocity]].
