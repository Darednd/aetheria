Formed by the hand of [[Aetheria Bahamut Rissu]] and the #eidolon s.

Agreement:
* #eidolon s can no longer influence the world of humans themselves.
* Their champions may not kill each other, unless they threaten the lives of humans.
* They are to keep each other in check.
* The #eidolon s that did not want to participate in the calm, were banished.
* [[The Red Comet|The Exiled]] was an exception as his nature was destruction and he was a direct threat to humans, so he was to stay awake, but keep a distance.
