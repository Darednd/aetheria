The fundamental energy of all existence.

The #eidolon s happened to take shape by accident, as different energies of the same type gathered closer.

They needed sustenance - a way to generate, or channel the energy that is their existence unto themselves.

Out of the chaos, the #eidolon s created humans.

The vessels of chaos could channel this energy by way of worship.

However, the Eidolons were greedy and wanted this power and influence for themselves, even though it made no sense to have all energy converted into one single type.

This warring caused the first [[Pandemonium]] and the creation of [[The Balance]].
