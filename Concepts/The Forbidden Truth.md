The balance works because people stay ignorant. [[Eternis]], the prodigy, came to this realization and in an attempt to gain an advantage, shared it with [[Yoit Laran]] and [[Nexuchrox]]. This did not work, but as they seemingly fell, they carried this forbidden truth with them. [[Magala]] did not hear this, as he betrayed the others and watched them "die", becoming stronger and stronger.

The truth is that #eidolon's do not grant power, or blessings. They grant curses. Being a champion is merely accepting the full potency of the curse. It binds the cursed to be able to produce only the energy of their #eidolon, which feeds them and gives them a huge boost in power.

- This is the reason why #greaterRestoration removes ties with #eidolon s.
- This is the reason why [[Yoit Laran]] stopped being [[Ignis|The Wild]]'s champion and became [[Alatriyon]] after learning of this truth.
- This is the reason why [[Necron|The Reaper]] secluded himself on [[Wisira]] and began his research, so that he may secure his place as #eidolon.

[[Arcanists]] are very close to the truth. They know that people can generate this energy that feeds the #eidolon s and gives them power. They are developing technology that would revert the spent energy back to [[Ether]].
