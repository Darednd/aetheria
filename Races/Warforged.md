Invented by [[Fi'lor Sharian]] and then bought by the [[Rulers of Noir City]] to guard its streets. These mechanical and very capable fighters keep the streets safe from criminals and troublemakers. Armed with canons and boasting high durability these perfect soldiers keep the city safe to live in.

In turn, [[Fi'lor Sharian]] gets a lot of money from the town's subscription to his services, as he also has the means to terminate and control them. This allows him to get away with some shady stuff in his research. And it also places him in a place of power...
