Invented by [[Fi'lor Sharian]] mainly as helpers and utility bots. They mostly serve the town's taverns as waiter-bots. However, their creator continues to experiment with various sources of blood when creating them, so some of them are worthy enough of being sent to the [[Exsanguinated Temple]]. Such a case was [[SF]], an autognome that inherited a bit of the blood of [[The Legendary Monk]].

Same as with the [[Warforged]], [[Fi'lor Sharian]] is gaining a significant sum of money for these bots' services from the town. He also gains a lot of prestige, trust and power, as his services are premium.
