In their crazy experiments, [[Psionus|The Dreamer]] eventually sought to create a race of loyal and faithful servants with psychic powers that would serve their cause on [[The Material Realm|the Material Plane]].

Success was finally achieved when [[Rhusham Zeihlu]] encountered the first [[Party]] and was utterly humiliated by them. Stripped naked and his friends turned to mush by [[Khirhan]], he swore that he will start a new life and quit any and all [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]] activities. [[Psionus|The Dreamer]]'s attention was caught by this, which was a rare occasion (random roll determined) and in Rhusham's delirium they made contact. His faith, wavered, was fully restored and stronger than ever. He would swear loyalty and voluntarily accept the experiments that the church would do to him in order to create the first of this race.

The procedure is gruesome and usually binds the transformed individuals into the class of blood hunters, but can also produce sorcerers. It involves replacing parts of their flesh and tissue with chunks of the immaterial city of [[Pandora]], the remaining physical part of [[Psionus]]. In the beginning, such parts were offered to [[Abraham]] but with [[Finitus]] on the thrown, they are more readily available. The trick that they discovered with [[Aeon]] was that only non-vital organs should be replaced - e.g. a part of the liver, one kidney, a piece of skin, or muscle, the tongue, the reproductive organs... Anything vital, such as the heart, brain, or the like, would result in death of the subject.

The church, after the first success and after some time of recovery after the ascended [[Khirhan]]'s rampage in [[Valgrum]], starts mass producing such eldritch-borne soldiers and starts sending them across the globe, to be [[Psionus|The Dreamer]]'s and Finn's eyes and ears.

[[Aeon]] is sent to [[Alaerela Continent]], to keep watch over [[Reyes]], as his dual nature, with the [[Reyes-touched Monkey (Rajang)]] horn embedded into him, would give him an advantage.

### Traits
Unlike regular Aasimar, eldritch-borne can choose to add their +2 stat bonus to intelligence instead of charisma. They get an additional +1 to a stat of their choice different than the chosen one for the +2 bonus.

Apart from having dark vision, they also have 10ft blindsight.

Instead of spectral wings, they have an ability that lets them unleash the accumulated eldritch energy inside of them and get +2 to their AC and be able to warp up to 10ft for 1 minute between long rests.
