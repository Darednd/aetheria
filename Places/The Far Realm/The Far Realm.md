alias: The Space Beyond
---
Also known as [[The Far Realm|The Space Beyond]]. A realm created by the greatest and most volatile mind to ever exist - [[Eternis]]'s. This four-dimensional space is not one for regular creatures to traverse, as their brains are too used to the three dimensions the [[The Material Realm]] offers and exists in.

Apart from being imperceivable by any normal being, this realm allows the ones attuned to it to traverse huge distances by passing through it.

Currently, the only living beings aware of this space are [[Finn]] and [[Eternis]].

Instances where this space was utilized:
- [[The Deceased City - Yoz'egna#The Downfall]]
- [[Finn's Ascension]]
- [[Aeon]] being sent to the [[Party 3]]
