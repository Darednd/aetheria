The only town on the [[Euwetax Continent]]. The chief [[Ephezok]], leads the village and helps the people any way he can. He is also the local judge and the severe cases he turns into thralls with his intellect devourers.

Due to the exposure of the village to the surrounding forest, injuries are quite frequent. Especially for the people who do the hunting. However, kids also get hurt, sometimes wandering around the village and getting attacked by lesser aberrations. [[Ephezok]] treats these injuries as best he can and also provides protection to the village with his intellect devourers.
