Huge city at the southern coast of the [[Arax Continent]]. Also known as "The Grace of the Mother". The name of the city is in some old form of draconic.

The city is ruled by the heads of [[The 6 Dragon Families]]. The Bahamut royal family rules over the whole upper layer, while each part of the city in the lower layers is ruled by one of the other 5 families.

Visitors get a #visitCard which depicts the different areas and layers, as well as is enchanted and can provide guidance to whoever holds it, as well as convey messages from the #highMage 's of the #archMage himself.

Each area has a single tavern named after it (e.g. White Area Tavern for the White Area). The taverns are huge and can host a large amount of visitors. They are usually lead by a dragonborn of the same color as the area.

Each area is guarded by pair patrols of [[AM Mage Guard]]s with their dragonnels.

The city is made up of two layers, the lower and upper layer. In order to travel between any area or plateau to another, teleportation gates exist.

#### The Lower Layer
The lower layer is consisted of the Black, Blue, Green, Red and White Area. Each area is governed by a gem dragon of the corresponding color.

##### Black Area
Obsidian dragon essence - #highMage [[Xamuth Zorill]].
Royal family - Zoril.
The leading and central institution is the Obsidian Castle, which looks more like a zigurat 
than anything else.
This, somewhat eccentric area is primarily focused on the studies on the school of necromancy.
- [[Necron]]'s champion candidate is located here. People have been misteriously disappearing, or are being found dead.
Treat - Black special, a cookie with a soft texture wrapped in dark chocolate. The cookie is made with sorbet and is a bit soury, whereas the chocolate is always melty and never solidifies. Messy to eat, but very tasty.

##### Blue Area
Sapphire dragon essence - #highMage [[Rudres Kavag]]
Royal family - Kavag. 
The central building is the Sapphire Castle, a square, almost voxel art style in the center of the area.
The area's main focus is the study of abjuration magic and enchantments.
- [[Ef]] ran away from here and is currently in [[Fadon]].
Treat - Blue special, square ice-cream cone with blue cream in it. The cream has a sweet taste with a line of something refreshing. Cone fragments, sprinkles and chocolate pieces are mixed into the cream, keeping the texture dynamic when its eaten. The cream is not fully frozen and is pretty soft. This is a cold dessert, but never causes brain freezes.

##### Green Area
Emerald dragon - #highMage [[Iarvuth Dain]]
Royal family - Dain.
The central building is the Emerald Castle, a round, Taj Mahal like castle in the center of the area.
The area's main focus is the study of the moons.
Treat - Green special, green balls, covered in a mossy texture, seemingly some type of fungus. The texture is pretty weird at first, as the surface sticks and dissolves immediately in the mouth, but the interior is mushy goodness. Chocolate, nuts... delicious.

##### Red Area
Ruby dragon - #highMage [[Zesi Dhanan]]
Royal family - Dhanan.
The central building is the Ruby Castle, flaming spires surrounding it, in the center of the area.
The area's main focus is the study of evocation magic.
Treat - Red special, a red sundae, overflowing with red covering. The covering is interestingly a bit hot to the taste, but is also sweet at the same time. The cream of the sundae is a mix of different forest fruits, mostly berries of all kinds and has a sweet and sour taste. The covering seemingly never stops pouring from the center of the cream-filled glass, as a living volcano, making this a messy food to eat. The taste and refreshment are definitely worth it.

##### White Area
Moonstone dragon essence - #highMage [[Uthio Rissu]]
Royal family - Rissu.
The central building is the Moonstone Castle, with spikey towers, in the center of the area.
The area's main focus is the study of divination magic. The area is also famous for its library and archives.
Treat - Panna Cotta with an almost frozen texture. Vanilla flavored, but with a bit of extra magical goodness. The white covering is cool and chocolatey.

#### The Upper Layer
The upper layer is consisted of the Brass, Bronze, Copper, Silver and Gold plateaus. All of these 5 plateaus float in mid air thanks to the great magic bestowed to the arch-mage of the city - [[Ashk]], by [[Aeris|The Mother]].
Treats - Unlike the lower levels, the upper layers sell all sorts of pastries with different fillings depending on the color of the plateau.

##### Brass Plateau
##### Bronze Plateau
##### Copper Plateau
##### Silver Plateau
##### Gold Plateau
It is here that the [[Kayan]]s are being bread, by [[Ashk]] himself.
##### Platinum Plateau
This plateau is not inhabited by civilians and is the smallest of the bunch, containing only a single small house where [[Ashk]] is in the natural form of his draconic essence. Only [[Ashk]] himself can teleport someone to this location and it is legendarily difficult to see it from the outside in the other districtcs.
