Inside [[The Great Charybdis]], an island floats above the swirling waves. Or maybe it is attached to the mainland of the [[Alaerela Continent]] in some way, as the whirlwind is not strong enough to take it apart and swallow it.

Having one of the most breathtaking sights in all of [[Places/Aetheria/Aetheria|Aetheria]], a clear look at the eye of the maelstrom, this place has become quite a popular attraction. Some people save up money to visit it just to behold the sight, some visit often and relish the nearly enlightening and divine landscape, or waterscape. But most importantly, scholars reside in the highest of towers on this island, studying the maelstrom and its recent anomalies.
