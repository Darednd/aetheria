A sandy town located at the start of the [[Zhaso Desert]]. People would usually wear thin, cotton clothes and turbans, but after the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]] established posts in the city, turbans were forbidden.

Houses are made of stone (think Star Wars like).

A few churches are being built in town.

There are [[Kayan]] stables in this town, used by the church staff to cross the desert and transfer goods to the building site in [[Fadon]].
