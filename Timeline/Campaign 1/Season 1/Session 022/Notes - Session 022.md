[[Ashk]]
- Asks [[Khirhan]] if he is willingly tied to [[The Red Comet|The Exiled]].
- Explains that no #eidolon can force you into a relationship, except one, [[Psionus|The Dreamer]]. Everyone else is by choice and can be severed with the right attitude.
- Asks [[Finn]] and [[Vince]] as well.
- If desired, can break the connection with [[Khirhan]]'s axe with a #greaterRestoration spell. 
	- [[Khirhan]] has a talk with [[Aeris|The Mother]] who asks him what he is fighting for.
	- Depending on how that goes, [[Aeris|The Mother]] can repair the medallion and restore the axe to its original form, only strengthened by crystals.

[[Anburora Maton#Black Area]]
- [[Xamuth Zorill]] and his quest for the stone inscriptions.
	- Asks the [[Party]] to prove themselves somehow, so that he knows it's not an empty investment.
	- If agreed, lets the party choose a magical item(s) from a catalogue, which he will procure for them.
	- Gives the party a semi-transparent piece of paper and explains how taking the "photo" would work, with the keyword "Clax".
	- Gives them an enchanted compass that will lead them to the catacombs.
	- Gives them a dark potion that, when shattered on the ground, will teleport creatures of their choice back to that particular room.
	- No reward if emptyhanded, but no harm done if they come back alive.
	- Warns them not to stay too long on the surface - anything moves, it wants to kill you.
- [[Necron]]'s champion to be - [[Tiche]]
