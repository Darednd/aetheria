Middle of day 2 - arrive at crossroads.

Military camp there. A few soldiers, a priest and a cleric.

Either [[Treim]] or [[Places/Aetheria/Valgrum Continent/Orkham/Orkham]] later.

[[Kayan]]s north of [[Valgrum]] needed to pass [[Zhaso Desert]].

[[Kayan]] stables in [[Places/Aetheria/Valgrum Continent/Orkham/Orkham]] with [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]] owned birds.

Potential [[Chase in Zhaso Desert]].
Otherwise stroll with [[Kayan]]s https://youtu.be/4E-_Xpj0Mgo

Acquiring a ship in [[Places/Aetheria/Valgrum Continent/Fadon/Fadon]]. Maybe a dungeon?
