Flumphs at night, providing artificial light, feeding off of peoples emotions and thoughts, even dreams.

The girl that served food at the restaurant and that witnessed [[Khirhan]]'s and [[Om Saurbough]]'s handshake and received the painting from [[Khirhan]], will provoke him. 

# #day15 - [[Finn]] gets symptoms

[[Ephezok]] will want to talk to everyone again, especially [[Finn]] and [[Vince]].
- A helmet with the same dark texture as the castle can be seen in one corner of [[Ephezok]]'s room.
- After some research, he concluded that illusion is mostly [[Venus|The Vile]] and [[Psionus|The Dreamer]] territory, being deceptive and changing reality and affecting perception.
- Interesting how they didn't know about Eidolons.
- He wants them to tell him more about the church they mentioned. [[Eternis]] is not on the circle, not is his symbol.
	- This prompts him to do some research, after which he will find out that #eidolon energy can be siphoned and channeled. He will eventually find out about the fabrication of eidolons.

The #blacksmith - [[Gum Shakei]]
The excentric (hunting horn user) - [[Ral Bedotsk]]

Encounter: [[Reyes-touched Monkey (Rajang)]]
