#day25
[[Seded]] offers the party the [[Auction Heist]] job.
- Their snooping around has brought their attention to an opportunity.
- They have an agreement not to involve themselves in their job, doesn't mean a third party can't. Especially if they get paid by what they take.

#day26 [[Magala]] arrives in [[Fadon]]
- https://youtu.be/k1frgt0D_f4
- Wants to talk to the whole party, as he senses an interesting combination of smells.
- Wants them to become champions of their chosen #eidolon s so that they can form an alliance and win the second [[Pandemonium]] war, reaping the rewards themselves.
