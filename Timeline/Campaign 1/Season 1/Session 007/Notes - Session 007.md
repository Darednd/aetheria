Interrogation by [[Sebastiano]], [[Fabio]], [[Dahlia]] and [[Sabina]]
- Calls the [[Party]] #heretics
- Recognizes [[Finn]] - "Well if it isn't Sharian's boy."
- Is polite with them.
- Makes it clear that the [[Party]] will ask no questions and that if they are compliant, they will let them go.
- Asks them to drop their weapons and move around the [[Pyramid]] antechamber hole to get away from them.
- IF THE PARTY RUNS AWAY IN THE HOLE - "We won't pursue, we will wait for a few days and then leave you stranded here, without any [[Kayan]]s."
- IF THE PARTY WANTS TO FIGHT - "VIolence is not the way of [[Eternis|the Eternal]], but we will not hold back. And with [[Eternis|the Eternal]] on our side, there is only one outcome of this battle."
	- Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMK3JU6At9k
	- Knocks them unconscious and takes them back to [[Valgrum]].
	- When they wake up on their [[Kayan]]'s - "You have two choices, stay calm, or we will knock you out again."
- IF THE PARTY IS COMPLIANT
	- We know about your epxloits. Camp infiltration, killing soldiers. Mind you, those people had families, children who now have no one to provide for them. But don't worry, the church will take care of them, we are not heartless... And finally you caused a ruckus in [[Orkham]], the place I ([[Sebastiano]]) was overseeing, stealing and letting loose a lot of [[Kayan]]s, injuring soldiers, panicking the locals...
	- Question: Why?
	- Question: What is your goal?
	- Question: Why do you have such a bad impression on us? Are laws and rules that bad?
		- If the [[Party]] comments on racism - I'm assuming you know nothing about our history. Is it fair for you to make assumptions based on no knowledge whatsoever?
	- Ultimatum: Since we are good people, we will forgive you. But we have to banish you from this continent. Go to [[Fadon]] and take a ship to anywhere, but never return. If we ever see you, you will be pursued and executed. + Gives them 1500 gp.
