[[Shrine of Venus]]
- Disgusting aura of the entombed entity can already be felt
- The room is twice as large as the antechamber the [[Party]] entered the labyrinth from
- If they open the hatch, #illusoryDragon is cast

If/when they surface, [[Sebastiano]], [[Dahlia]], [[Sabina]] and [[Fabio]] are waiting for them with 4 spare [[Kayan]]s. 

Acquiring a ship in [[Fadon]].
3 choices:
- [[Ingrid]] with the poor [[Mud Bath]] ship.
- [[Calra Farchaser]] with the mediocre ship [[Sour Pot]].
- [[Ildiran]] with the luxurious [[The Enterprise]] ship.

Chance for encounter with [[Fadon Pirates]]

If they arrive at [[Euwetax Continent]], [[Chuul Encounter]]
