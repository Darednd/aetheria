+ 0 PC (Primordial Chaos)
+ Primordial Chaos
+ Elements shuffled into one chaotic mass. Nothing else exists.

+ ~5000 PC
+ The Forming of the [[Eidolons]]
+ Out of the chaos, energy of the same type eventually coagulated and formed the first beings - the #eidolon s. They will continue attracting and gathering their type of energy for the rest of their existence. Initially, they were formless masses of energy, however that will change in the future...

+ ~7500 PC
+ The Forming of the Solar System
+ The rampant energy, not yet stable, along with the #eidolon s, eventually took the form of a solar system. The Sun, the source of the chaotic energy was surrounding by a single rotating planet, which will later come to be known as [[Places/Aetheria/Aetheria|Aetheria]].

+ ~10 000 PC
+ The First Creatures
+ The continuous evolution of the unstable energy will eventually result in life appearing on [[Places/Aetheria/Aetheria|Aetheria]]. All sorts of creatures began their existence, from the smallest of insects, to the tallest of dragons and the human races inbetween. However, life was hard and the creatures' connections with the #eidolon s caused great wars to be fought, destroying the surface of the planet in the process.</br></br>The #eidolon s quickly figured out that these creatures can further fuel their power by generating the energy that they are made of, so a race for influence began and an unsigned deal was made for them to not cause any more destruction than they can help.

+ 0 PH (Post Human)
+ [[The Dragon Crisis]]
+ Since the beginning, humans were in constant war with dragons and were severely underpowered in the unfair war. The dragons had a much stronger attunement with the #eidolon s and this gave them great advantages. All the champions in the past were dragons. But, humans are they always do, adapted and with a bit of help from some kinder dragons, including [[Bahamut]], who would pioneer the rebelion against the dragon regime.

+ 27 PH
+ [[The Deceased City]]
+ A strand of human genome that was capable of amazing psychic deeds, not short of manipulating reality itself. But, as with everything, outliers exist and one caused the death of the most advanced civilization, no matter how short-lived it was.

+ 54 PH
+ The First Dragonborn
+ The kinder dragons shared their essence with humanity. This gave rise to [[The 6 Dragon Families]] - the first dragonborn people, who would continue their lineage through the history of the world. These 6 families stroke back on the dragons that opressed them. Humanity had a fighting chance.

+ 66 PH
+ The Birth of [[NPCs/Aetheria|Aetheria]]
+ The love between two dragon families, the platinum and moonstone ones, paved the way for a new event in the world. A baby girl named [[NPCs/Aetheria|Aetheria]]. This little dragonborn would become the first, and only [[The Champion of Chaos]] and the world will thank her until she is forgotten through the ages. For if she had used her power for evil, naught would have existed.

+ 91 PH
+ [[NPCs/Aetheria|Aetheria]]'s Pilgrimage
+ At the age of 25, the beautiful and determined youth would decide to travel the world, learn and find a way to end all wars on the planet. Joined by her faithful and fateful companions, she begins her quest to define the way things are known as they are.

+ 97 PH
(0 PB - Post Balance)
+ Forming of [[The Balance]]
+ [[NPCs/Aetheria|Aetheria]], having visited most #eidolon s, gained the support of some and the ire of others, returns home. She speaks with her family and they create one of the great cities - [[Anburora Maton]]. With a protective layer to shield against everything but the #eidolon s themselves, she jurneys to speak with the champions of the #eidolon s - the leaders of [[The Dragon Faction]]. Led by [[Fatalis]] himself, they would not listen, seeing violence and eternal struggle as the only way forward. A short war is waged and the girl annihilates most dragons, including their champions. Having visited most of the #eidolon s, and possessing a piece of them, she summons them where [[Valgrum]] will be built in the future. Either a balance is forged, or they tear each other apart here and now. Having the support of at least half of the primordials, the other half knew it was a losing battle, with nothing to be gained. Forced into it, [[NPCs/Aetheria|Aetheria]] forged [[The Balance]] with a compromise and with that, ended [[The Dragon Crisis]].

+ ~0 PB
+ Devil's Advocate
+ As soon as [[The Balance]] was forged, the evil-inclined #eidolon s immediately began plotting and finding loopholes in the contract. And the one with the biggest amount of ideas was [[Psionus]], who would start plotting immediately, by creating [[Eternis]].

+ 645 PB
