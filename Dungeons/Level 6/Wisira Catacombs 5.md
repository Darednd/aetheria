#### 1. The Entrance
A 6x6ft opening, vertical stairs leading underground around 30ft.

#### 2. Trophy Room
A 12x48ft room, laiden with heads, displayed as trophies.
Each head is trapped and upon being touched releases a jolt of necrotic energy. The creature that touched it must make a DC 14 CON saving throw and take 3d6 necrotic damage on a fail, or half as much on a success.

#### 3. Closet
This 6x12ft room is closed with locked sliding doors. The doors can be picked (DC 15) or broken. The doors are trapped and if not disarmed (DC 18) when the door is opened cause necrotic fumes to burst out of it and force any create in the vicinity to make a DC 14 CON saving throw, taking 4d6 necrotic damage on a fail, or half as much on a success.

#### 4. Meditation Room
Music https://youtu.be/qifJOZF5A0s
A circular (30ft radius) room with a cyan bonfire in the middle. Some undead have wondered in here and will attack anyone on sight.

#### 5. Strong Room
Similarly to the closet, the 6x6ft room is sealed shut and can only be opened by sacrificing a body part, another living being, or self. The pick DC is 25. The safe cannot be broken and is immune to any and all damage.

#### 6. Chapel
The chapel is actually just a fountain of black liquid. The black liquid causes necrosis to anything it touches, leaving darkened coloring and slowly numbing the extremity, eventually fully consuming and offering the limb, or even creature, to [[Necron|The Reaper]].

#### 7. Stone Tablet Room
