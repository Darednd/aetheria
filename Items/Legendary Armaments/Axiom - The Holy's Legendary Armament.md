Deals 2d8 (versatile 2d10) damage and 2d12 radiant damage.

Effect 1: Once per long rest, by slamming the hammer into the ground, the wielder can cause sentient creatures in a radius of 30ft to stop being aggressive and be compelled to tell the truth for 1 hour. The spell save DC for this effect gets a +3 bonus.

Requires attunement.
Attuned upon awakening.
[[Sanctus|The Holy]] aligned person attuned to this weapon gains 5 legendary resistances which replenish on long rests and also has 3 legendary actions.

**Radiant Spear**: As a bonus action, you can conjure and hurl a spear made of radiant energy towards one creature you can see within 60ft. (120 with disadvantage). The spear, on hit, deals 4d6 radiant damage and the creature must make a DEX saving throw (your spellcasting DC) or be blinded until the start of their next turn.

**Consecration**: (recharge 5-6) You can use your action, or expend two legendary actions to charge the hammer and hit the ground, causing a cone of radiant energy to spread across the ground and explode after a short time. Any creature within the consecrated area must make a DEX saving throw (your spellcasting DC) or be knocked prone. On a failed save, the creature takes 12d12 radiant damage, or half as much on a successful one.
