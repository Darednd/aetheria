Requires attunement.
Level 1: Once per day, allows communication with [[Psionus]]. While doing so, the owner of the item is considered incapacitated.

Level 2: Additionally, allows the person attuned to this item to once per day cast [[Mass Detect Thoughts]]. When casting this spell, the medalion shines with a dark green color and depending on the number and fortitude of the people being read, may vibrate or even float and spin.

Level 3: The owner is no longer incapacitated while the communication is active.

Level 4: The owner can use an action to phase a part of them (up to their full size, with the things they are carrying) through space, up to 15ft (5m). This can be a hand, an eye, or their full body. This provokes attacks of opportunity.

Found by [[Finn]] at the altar of the [[Psionus Shrine]] at #day1 .

Can be transformed to a multidimensional representation of both the [[Psionus]] and [[Eternis]] symbols.
