A rare crimson jewel excavated from the [[Exsanguinated Temple]]. It is in fact something that has formed into the body of [[Thysia]], one of the long forgotten #eidolon s.

[[Fi'lor Sharian]] wants to study it, but [[Necron]] has warned him of the dangers it may posses and that it is better for him and the ones around him to let someone else do the dirty work and potentially, suffer the consequences.

He seals it in a strongbox, stuffed with soft material to avoid getting it chipped and requests an individual or a group to escort it to [[Alaerela Continent]], namely [[El]], on the [[Par'makh Peninsula]]. How the individuals travel there is not his concern. Once the individuals are there, the strongbox will be unlocked and payment received from within. A letter of introduction is also provided in a side-pocket of the strongbox with [[Fi'lor Sharian]]'s signature and seal.

Effects
- If broken, grants an audience with [[Thysia]]
- However, in order to do so, it consumes the flesh and bones of surrounding creatures
- If no creature is present, or not enough flesh can be consumed, the life of the person who broke it is forfeit.
- [[Thysia]] creates a [[Tyrant]], to mock the request whose precondition couldn't be fulfilled.
- In case it works, the person who broke the fragment can have a talk with the #eidolon  directly and will be tempted to join her cause and make a deal.
