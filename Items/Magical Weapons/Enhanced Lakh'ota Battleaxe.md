#day22 Due to the strong influence of [[The Red Comet|The Exiled]], the axe has most of its dynamic parts melded and is now permanently a greataxe. It can no longer cause laceration and deals 1d8 dragon damage instead of the 1d6 force it previously did.

+1 Lacerating Greataxe
CON saving throw or causes [[Laceration]]
