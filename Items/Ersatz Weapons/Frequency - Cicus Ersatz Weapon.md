### Sword Mode

**Big bang**: (recharge 6) While in sword mode, a small humming oscillating ball converges at the top of the sword. As an action, or using 2 legendary actions, the ball can be discharged, causing violent vibrations to tear the space in front of the user in a 15ft radius sphere, whose center is also 15ft away from the user. All affected creatures must make a CON saving throw (your save DC). On a failed save, they take 10d12 thunder damage and are deafened. On a success, they only take half of the damage, without being deafened.

**Discharge**:  As an action, or using one legendary action, instead of attacking, the user can choose to convert surrounding [[Ether]] into violent thunder energy causing a sonic boom. This is not considered an attack, but a skill. The boom manifests as a 5ft radius sphere, which the user can discharge up to 15ft away. All creatures in the area must make a CON saving throw (your save DC). On a failed save, they take 4d12 thunder damage, or half as much on a success.

### Axe Mode

The weapon can change forms as a bonus action. The sword morphs into an axe by pulling the blade along the outline of the sword, leaving the bottom part of the blade as the axe blade head.

All attacks that hit while in this mode cause the recharge die for the **Big bang** attack to be rolled and adds 1d12 to the damage of the next time it is used.
