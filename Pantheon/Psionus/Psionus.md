The Psychic Elemental Eidolon. Usually, when they decide to show themselves, they take the appearance of a small black and white cat. In reality, they are an unimaginable aberrant creature which could rend a mortal's mind broken if they show their true form.

Also a book with songs that paint a picture about them.

The real nature of this #eidolon is that they are the remnant of [[The Deceased City - Yoz'egna]]. They are the only Eidolon that did not initially exist, but was created through the will of mortals, although unwantedly. In reality, the eidolon is [[The Far Realm]] itself and all the consciousness within it, centered at the city of [[Pandora]], if one can call it that.

When manifesting in [[The Material Realm]], they are always wandering and teleporting. Nobody knows what they really look like due to their enormously powerful psychic abilities. When creatures interact with them, they do so through heavy hallucinations.
