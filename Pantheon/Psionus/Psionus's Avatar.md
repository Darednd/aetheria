A baby named [[Eternis]] was broken in by [[Psionus]] gaining immense magical powers, but eventually succumbed to [[Psionus]]'s influence and was turned into his avatar. This avatar was the main origin of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]]. The church is now awaiting for the return of the one true god, [[Eternis]].

If [[Finn]] was to be taken over by the #symbiont living inside his belly, he risks being eventually converted to the Avatar of the upcoming over-God [[Eternis]].

After [[Finn's Ascension]], [[Psionus|The Dreamer]] found more value in him being his [[Champions|Champion]] rather than his avatar. He was also enticed by the chance that [[Conor]]'s daughter, [[Anie]] was of [[The Chaos Lineage]].

However, all plans were thwarted and now, [[Psionus|The Dreamer]] wants to scout the world, looking for a good match for his new avatar.
