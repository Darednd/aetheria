### Past

A gifted, yet unstable mind, born in the forgotten city. With great power and madness to match, caused the creation of [[The Far Realm]], the mutation and death of his birthplace, now [[The Deceased City - Yoz'egna]], the creation of mindflayers and the events to follow. This is the only instant of an #eidolon who has ascended from a mortal.

Much later, after the balance was formed, one of his experiments bore fruit. A [[Daelkyr]] half-blood, born with the influence of [[Psionus]]. Performed miracles in his life but was eventually overtaken by his progenitor. Caused the forming of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]].  Eventually he became [[Psionus's Avatar]] and after a large scale battle, assisted by [[Necron]], [[Venus]] and [[Ignis]], he was defeated and slain.

### Present

The upcoming over-God. [[Psionus]] has tricked the people into believing that there is one true god and that everyone believing otherwise is a heretic and if not converted has to be purged. This has lead to the number of believers of the over-God to increase and the number of believers of the old gods to diminish. This, in turn, has caused a lot of the power of the the other old gods to syphon into him, making him more powerful and influential, further advancing his plan.

A piece of the avatar is now in [[Finn]]'s body, serving as a source of power and connection with [[Psionus]]. It can also be used as a medium with which [[Psionus]] will overtake [[Finn]] and produce another avatar.
