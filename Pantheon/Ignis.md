The Fire Elemental Eidolon. A proud being resembling a manticore in some ways. 4-legged, furry wings and a lion's mane. Twisted horns sprouting from its head and sun-level temperatures around his body. Few can withstand being near this star.

Residing in the [[Raehand Continent]], it is the main reason why the volcano is constantly active and the temperature so hot. If not for the heat tolerance of the Fire Genasi that inhabit this area, the only creatures that would call this continent home would be the fire elementals.

Also a book with some songs which paint a picture about him.
