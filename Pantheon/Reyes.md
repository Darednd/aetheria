  - The Rage

A Lightning Elemental Eidolon. Much like the [[Stygian Zinogre]], this wolf-like being is riddled with unbreakable spikes, some even shaped like lightning. Sharp, lightning shaped blades on the sides of its arms, in its rage, it can make minced meat out of almost any creature without any significant difficulty. The true apex of the [[Alaerela Continent]]. The multiple [[Reyes-touched Monkey (Rajang)]] horns coming from the sides of his head not only warn creatures away, but also serve as lightning rods, accumulating, redirecting and producing lightning all the time.

Also a book with some songs which paint a picture about him.

It is painfully obvious when this creature is active, and it always is. A huge storm looming over it anywhere it goes. Unreasonably strong lightning desolating the area around it, this creature is a walking catastrophe. If [[The Balance]] didn't exist, there would be no life on [[Alaerela Continent]] and this can be said with absolute certainty.
