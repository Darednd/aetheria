An warforged monk who was sent briefly to work for [[The Boss]] in [[Callowahry]].

Maker - ?

Inside the maze of [[The Abyss]], he threw himself over the edge, swam through the raw #ether towards the prison of [[Malzeno]] and released him by unscrewing his head and leaking his bodily fluids (equivalent to blood) on the bronze pipes which make the prison up.

His body was reclaimed by [[Necron]], as soon as he did that.
