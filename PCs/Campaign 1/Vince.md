Full name: Vince Donderen

Birthday: 20.03.x (D80)

Born and raised in [[Valgrum]], in the [[The Red Lotus]] brothel.

Took over the brothel and got tired.

Joined the [[Wanderers (Талкачите)]] and traveled the world, performing all sorts of songs, plays and shows with them using his drums. Learned magic from [[Fi'el Eladrin]], the performers group's leader.

Got tired of them as well and decided to search for more interesting, or the most interesting story he can find, be it by finding it or being a part of it.

**Traits:** Hates boring people, slightly racist against old people with big white beards (also wizards), loves to make a scene, does not hold back on words...

- [[Wanderers (Талкачите)]] - former member

Relations:
- [[Fi'el Eladrin]] - learned magic from and traveled with his performers group
