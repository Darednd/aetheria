### Backstory

Half orc barbarian(wild magic) 
  
 #### [[Lakh’ota Orc Tribe]]
 
**Khirhan** was born in the nomadic orc tribe called [[Lakh’ota Orc Tribe]]. Growing up he was the weakest child in the clan and was looked down upon. He would often get sick and the only one taking care of him was his mother [[Esma]] who was the clans healer, his father [[Julius Cicero]] he had never met and the only thing his mother told him about him was that he was from a different kind of tribe. During his travels with the clan he would often wonder off alone exploring new places. Once he came upon a [[Khirhan's Blessing]], different than anything he had seen before, when he showed it to his friends they pushed him into it. They found him a few days later by the same hole lying unconscious with strange colorful lights around him. The clan believed it was a bad omen and Khirhan should be left behind but his mother plead to the clan leader [[Bokhan]] to give her a few days and help save Khiran.  
Khirhan woke up 5 days later his mother sitting by his side . When she saw him wake up she started talking and he could not make out what she was saying, the only thing he understood clearly was “the clan believes you are cursed and has exiled you… you are going to have to stay with your father now.. i will come to see you as often as I can…” he fell asleep again as she kissed him goodbye. The next time he woke up there was a human man standing nearby “Your finally awake boy, gather your strength we have work to do.”  
  
 #### Living with his father, [[Julius Cicero]], and first rage
  
Khirhan never thought he was half human but looking back it made more sense, he looked different than all the other orcs and everyone his age was twice as strong. [[Julius Cicero]] was a man of few words and even less patience. The moment Khirhan could stand on his feet he was put to work. From what he gathered his father used to be some sort of soldier even thou he never spoke about it Khirhan could tell just by looking at his scars and something about the way he moved reminded him about the fighters in the clan. He learned how to write and read from his father also how to defend himself in needed. Living with his father meant living near other humans too who were just as cruel as the orcs had been but this time he was the stronger one and anytime someone tried to hurt him he would give him a beating for only later a larger group to come and return the favor. One time when he was getting beat up by multiple people he got so angry let out a scream and all of the other kids around him were lying on the ground screaming they were blind. No one bothered him after that.  

#### Mother's visits and the [[Bone Necklace (Коскен Ѓердан)]]

His mother would come see him once every year around his birthday which was when the clan was traveling nearby. She would bring him different type of animal or monster teeth and tell him the story of how it was slain than they would put the same type of tooth on their necklace. One year when he was turning 14 his mother did not come nor did she come the next year or the one after that. He feared that something might have happened to her or worse she stopped caring about him. When he turned 18 he gathered his things and went to go find her before he left Julius gave him an axe and told him it belonged to his mother’s tribe. That’s the last time he’s seen him.  
 
 #### The fall of the [[Lakh’ota Orc Tribe]]
 
For nearly 2 years he searched along the tribes routes looking for his clan, one day he stumbled on an orcish skeleton, judging by the necklace Khirhan realized it was Bokhan the tribe leader. Latter he found others but nowhere did he find his mother body because non of the bodies had the same necklace as him. His search continues…
