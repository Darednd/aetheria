#### Parents
Mother ([[Aska Sharian]]) died in the great war some 15 years ago. She was a high level FUCKIN MAGE. dont know much of her exploits in the war. Was told she died like a hero defending her squad (by my father, [[Kleon De Hallertau]]). She was an elf. Father, a human, was a professor in art. Knew the city like the back of his hand. Was a drinker though. Escalated drinking after mothers death. He stopped to take care of me. Died at the age of 65-70, 2-3 years ago. Both moved to the city a long time ago. They loved it.

#### Finn
I am a half human half elven child. Friendly kid, wherever I go ppl kinda like me. I know how to talk to people, he gets em. Not very smart tho, but knows how to get by in the big city. A wimpy kid FLEGMA not that strong. Dosta kontakti i prijateli u gradot. Never did much. His parents left him a hefty inheritance to last him awhile. Spends his money on women drugs and drinks After the passing of the parents he starts abusing drugs and alcohol on a daily basis. Still kept in touch with his fathers work friend [[Georgie]].

#### Looks
Green and purple combination. Sword-shaped scar / birthmark on the ball of their right shoulder. Tattoos on his right arm are inspired by his mother.
