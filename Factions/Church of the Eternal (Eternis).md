#### The Clerics and Paladins of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]]

Occasionally, when [[Eternis]] has time and will, he sends orders to [[Abraham]] who then through his evangelists, fetches a young woman. This young woman, once taken to Abraham, goes through a ritual which, with the help of [[Eternis]], results in the birth of an Aasimar child. The happiness and pride of the parents is often shortlived, as these children are taken by the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|church]] once they are 6 years old and trained to be obedient Clerics and Paladins.
