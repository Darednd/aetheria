During [[The Dragon War]], 6 among the dragons extended a helping hand to humanity. These dragons would share their essence with the humans and create [[The 6 Dragon Families]] who will lead the war to its conclusion, together with a line of their offspring that will change the world - [[The Chaos Lineage]].
- [[Bahamut, The Noble - The Platinum Founding Dragon]]
- [[Rissu, The Kind - The Moonstone Founding Dragon]]
- [[Zorill, The Wicked - The Obsidian Founding Dragon]]
- [[Kavag, The Proud - The Sapphire Founding Dragon]]
- [[Dain, The Calm - The Emerald Founding Dragon]]
- [[Dhanan, The Fierce - The Ruby Founding Dragon]]

This merging of essences is what created dragonborns, as a race. The heads of [[The 6 Dragon Families]] became ones and later their seed spread and family tree grew so that today, the race exists alongside humans. Most, if not all humans alive in the present have a bit of essence from these founding families and dragons, which is why most humans have the potential to become [[Eidolon Champion]]s.
