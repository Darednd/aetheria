A faction of mercenaries in [[Fadon]]. Fight using their fists, legs. Not a lot of respect for mages, though they tolerate them.
"Mages are cunning, we prefer to solve things in a more straightforward way."

[[Seded]] instigated the [[Party]] to loot and destroy one of their werehouses so that they consider hiring them as guards.
