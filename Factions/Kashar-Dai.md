An undercover organization of mostly night elves. Their main goal is to overthrow the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|church]] and to bring back diversity to the [[Valgrum Continent]].

#### Whistles
They have a, somewhat thief's cant, way of communicating through different whistles, which they know by heart.

Some of the whistles are:
- 'Foreigner' - a party which is not a part of the organization. A member is only to communicate with them one on one. If they are in a group, contact should be avoided.

#### Clothes
The clothes of the [[Kashar-Dai]] are engraved in elvish words with different meaning. Some of them, rougly translated, mean the following:
- 'From shadows to shadows'
- 'The night embraces all'
- 'Diversity'

#### Members
- [[Redo]] - met the party in the SE part of the [[Valgrum Forest]]
- [[Elnaril Qindan]] - [[Vince]]'s father
