The party is to infiltrate a building's basement in [[Fadon]], cause damage and grab whatever they have in store for the next auction. No casualties are to be had and they cannot be seen.

If the [[Party]] accepts, [[Seded]] gives them 3 masks to cover their faces while doing the heist. It is recommended for them to wear them the whole night as soon as they are close to the target building.

Challenge 1: Get inside the basement
