Magala visits [[Finn]] on the [[Sour Pot]] due to sensing a strong connection with [[Psionus|The Dreamer]], even on [[Euwetax Continent]]. He hurts him badly and breaks a scale of [[Venus]], taking both of them in a pocket dimension. 

[[Venus]] and [[Psionus]] have a talk. [[Venus]] warns him that he should not repeat the same mistake he did so many years ago. "Why shouldn't we kill your champion in the making right now?" To which [[Psionus]] responds that [[Pandemonium]] is upon them and that they will need every ally they can get. Plus [[Finn]] has still not accepted him and he is not sure that he even will. [[Venus]] and his champion [[Magala]] ease up as the spell dissipates.

He asks him where he got his power and does not hold back and attacks if he resists. He also smells [[Aeris|her]] and [[Necron|The Reaper]] but the scent is much weaker. Might ask about [[Aeris|The Mother]].
