01:36 - The energy hits the crystal city and light shines everywhere. It continues moving through the #crystalite and finds its way to the center.
02:07 - In the throne room, sleeping, [[Sanctus|The Holy]] sits. The light touches him and his eyes open after aeons of slumber. Colm's equipment awakens, the runes ever-briliant. He holds [[Axiom - The Holy's Legendary Armament]], one of the #legendaryArmament s.
