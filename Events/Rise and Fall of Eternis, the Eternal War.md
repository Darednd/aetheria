#### [[Psionus's Avatar]] - [[Eternis]]

Long long ago, [[Psionus]], the god of dreams, madness, thoughts and the elemental of psychic damage, tired of the other gods' inertness, tried to more directly influence the world. He managed to create a humanoid avatar by corrupting the mind of a newborn baby. This human baby, or better yet, the [[Daelkyr]] half-blood, named [[Eternis]], grew up to be something like a messiah, slowly but surely losing his humanity and leaving room for [[Psionus]] to fully enforce his influence and presence into the material world. His powers originating from his aberrant birth.

#### Rise of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]]

The child's, now man's influence, spread across the [[Valgrum Continent]]. He did wonders and miracles and was widely accepted as a good doer. This caused people to unite and form the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]]. 

Eventually, as [[Psionus]] took over more and more, he expressed his intentions of being a ruler more than being a do gooder. This worried nations all around the world and they formed an alliance in order to take the world threat down.

After a colossal battle, aided by some of the other gods as well, including [[Necron]], [[Venus]] and [[Ignis]], [[Psionus's Avatar]] was defeated and slain.

This defeat inspired [[Psionus]] and after it, after his reduced influence and power, he continued influencing the minds of the early [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]] members, or founders into writing the [[Eternia]], the holy book. He instilled a hate towards non-humans as they were the cause of [[Eternis]]'s death.
