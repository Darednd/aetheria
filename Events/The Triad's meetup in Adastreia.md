#day24

[[Magala]], [[Namielle]] and [[Ashk]] convene in [[Adastreia]]. They become aware of the current state of [[Sanctus|The Holy]] and [[Aeris|The Mother]]'s actions to prevent the disbalance that is happening in [[Valgrum]]. Despite all her and [[Ashk]]'s efforts, it seems that a new [[Pandemonium]] is coming. This is reinforced by the fact that [[The Red Comet|The Exiled]] has joined the play.

#### Topic 1: The [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|church]]
[[Magala]] insists on wiping out all of the [[Valgrum]] continent.
[[Namielle]] suggests that waging war on the edges of [[Valgrum]] will have less casualties and could keep the status quo.
[[Ashk]] proposes non-violent measures, which, if broken, could lead to either one of the suggested approaches.
**Resolution:** [[Ashk]]'s proposal is accepted. War is inevitable if they do not listen and casualties are to be brought to a minimum.


#### Topic 2: [[The Red Comet|The Exiled]]
[[Magala]] suggests wiping out all affiliates and finding a way to destroy the fallen fragments.
[[Namielle]] suggests monitoring the situation and taking measures as needed.
[[Ashk]] insists on talking to the followers to decide himself whether they need to be stopped violently, or will listen to reason.
**Resolution:** [[Ashk]] takes it upon himself to seek out and locate all followers of [[The Red Comet|The Exiled]] and talk to them personally.

#### Topic 3: [[Pandemonium]]
[[Magala]] thinks it should be interesting to shake things up.
[[Namielle]] says that it is very important to keep the current status quo.
[[Ashk]] agrees with [[Namielle]], but thinks it is eventually inevitable for it to happen, so they should all prepare. He proposes that they make an alliance between themselves and fight together, to restore the balance once everything has settled down.
**Resolution:** [[Ashk]]'s suggestion is accepted and [[The Triad]] is officially formed.
