0:00 - 0:28 [[Finn]] is tinkering with the medalion
0:28 - 0:47 He remembers the night when it all happened
0:47 - 1:00 He starts moving the parts as if it is natural for him
1:00 - 1:14 He does a move that should not be possible by any and all physical laws
1:14 - 1:37 The medalion begins to move on its own and lift in the air, beginning to look like a hologram, illusion, more than a real object
1:37 - 1:50 The hologram begins to clear up and [[Finn]] sees the symbol he is familiar with, as the medalion rotates, seeing it from a different angle, he sees another symbol, the one of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]]. They are shown interchangably.
1:50+ Psionus shows himself in the female form [[Finn]] is familiar with, winks at him and does a "shhh" gesture.
