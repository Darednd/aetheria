The same day the [[Julius Massacre]] happened, [[Khirhan]] was pushed by other orc kids from his tribe into a hole with a strange glow. The hole itself was an entrance to one of the [[Underground Temple of Aeris]]. The combined feelings of the father's rage and the child's fear drew her attention and she gave a blessing to both of them.

To the father, she gifted an [[Lakhâ€™ota Orc Tribe|enchantment]] and to the son, a more precious gift. The gift of magic. Through her will he was lifted from the depths of the temple to the surface, and in his soul a new tether was woven.
