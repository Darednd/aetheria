War that lasted 97 years, or the whole PH (post human) era. From the creation of the first living creatures and the [[Eidolons]] inhabiting the planet, the lesser beings aspired to dominate what they could. Among them, the most intelligent ones were the dragons and the humans.

Humans were on the losing end of the war, as only dragons could become champions of the #eidolon s, which gave them an even bigger advantage than they already had with their size, might and intelligence.

This unfairness and injustice, lead by the #eidolon  of destruction and father of dragons - [[The Red Comet|Fatalis]] was motivation enough for some kinder and good / neutral aligned dragons to side with the humans and aid them in their efforts to win their independence and rightful place on the globe.

Among them, 6 significantly powerful ones would leave a mark on history and the centuries to come. These 6, later called [[The Founding Dragons]], 54 years after the beginning of the era, shared their life essence with the humans, founding [[The 6 Dragon Families]], enabling humans to use #ether as their tool and also, become champions of the #eidolon s.

This gave humans a significantly better fighting chance and the tide started to turn. Cities were formed, civilizations begun rising, humans started practicing and fighting for their rights. Casualties were great, but humans could multiply much faster than dragons, so they had good strength in numbers.

The resolution of this war would start after the birth of a special young girl called [[Aetheria Bahamut Rissu|Aetheria Bahamut Rissu]]. On the 66th year of the era, this baby, born of two of [[The 6 Dragon Families]] would become humanity's best chance of ending the war.

After the girl's pilgrimage to visit all #eidolon s, the forming of [[Anburora Maton]] and the forging of [[The Balance]], a short war is waged and [[Aetheria Bahamut Rissu|Aetheria Bahamut Rissu]], with all of humanity united, destroys most dragons and banishes [[The Red Comet|Fatalis]] from the planet - ending the nearly century long war in favor of humanity.
