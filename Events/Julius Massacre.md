After witnessing the horrific event of [[Aska's Defilement]], [[Julius Cicero]] goes into a rage and assaults the drunk soldiers with the [[Lakh'ota Battleaxe]] he received from [[Esma]]. After a long and hard battle, with the advantage he had from the soldiers being drunk, he massacred the whole unit. Most of his scars are from this very battle.

Once back in [[Valgrum]], he said they were heavily defeated and that he no longer feels like he can fight after what he has seen. Being a very successful General, the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|church]] lets him go.
