Event that occured around 25 years ago.
A roaming group of orcs, pressured by hunting parties of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]] and out of resources attacks the farm of [[Jack Peyton]], [[Abigail Peyton]] and [[Colm]]. 

[[Jack Peyton]] defends the farm best he can, but is overwhelmed by the brutality of the orcs.

[[Abigail Peyton]] mounts a horse and together with [[Colm]] tries to escape. Unfortunately, arrows strike her back and she only manages to get [[Colm]] out of danger before passing away.

[[Colm]] is found by [[Church of the Eternal - Soldier]]s and taken into an orphanage in [[Valgrum]].
