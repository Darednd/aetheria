Female. The first known #dracolich to exist on [[Places/Aetheria/Aetheria]].
Native and ruling the [[Wisira]] continent.
The original color of the #dracolich is no longer known, as the only remaining flesh on it has decayed beyond recognition. Now, a bundle of bones, decayed skin and flesh, the lich is one sight to behold, striking terror in any and all who witness its undead glory.
