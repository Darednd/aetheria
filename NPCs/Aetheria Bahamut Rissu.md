The person who created [[The Balance]]. Master of [[Ether|Chaos]], she gathered the #eidolon s and created [[The Balance]]. [[Ether|Chaos]] was henceforth referred to as [[Ether]]. The planet's name was henceforth known as [[Places/Aetheria/Aetheria]] in celebration of her deeds and the peace she fought for.

Daughter of [[Exal Bahamut]] and [[Makou Rissu]], she showed amazing potential and mastery over all elements, or over [[Ether|Chaos]] itself. This would lead to her realizing her power and eventually going on a pilgrimage with her [[Aetheria's Party|party]] of companions. This pilgrimage will lead to the end of [[The Dragon War]] and the forming of [[The Balance]].

She would live a happy life after her adventures are over and settle down in [[Anburora Maton]], but not as its ruler, as a regular citizen. She would marry and have many children, most of which will inherit at least some of her [[The Champion of Chaos|chaos champion]] energy. 

At an elderly age, she would ask [[Aeris]] and [[Sanctus]] to enshrine her in crystal in the castles of [[Adastreia]]. Where to this day, she rests. Still young in appearance, with open arms, awaiting the time she would be needed again.
