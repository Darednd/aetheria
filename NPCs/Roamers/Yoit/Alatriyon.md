[[Yoit Laran]] new identity. He already has control of generating [[Ignis|The Wild]] and [[Glacies|The Mist]] energy and seeks to harness [[The Red Comet|The Exiled]]'s energy.

His horns are the catalyst to his aspirations and help him fully master and use the energy of the [[Eidolons]] as his own.

### Traveling with the [[Party 3]]

Days - #day56 to #day60

After meeting at the [[Crossroads (Place)]], he promises the party stories and in return he can travel with them towards [[Aramore]]. In reality, his aspiration was to arrive at the close-by [[Shards of the Exhiled]]. He hid his connection with the #eidolon 's over whose energy he had mastery. He did notice [[Norren]] sneaking up on him, even while invisible, which prompted the party to doubt him and they got the impression that he is way more powerful than he presents himself to be.

Down the road, they encounter the mutated (or punished, in [[The Purge]]) people that [[Finn]] sent for them. He showcased some of his abilities, but he didn't release a lot of #eidolon energy for them to notice his connection with either [[Ignis]] or [[Glacies]].

During their few day travel, he and [[Norren]] continued the investigation on [[Glacies|The Mist]] book that he studied. Against the flames they were able to read it and did discover some clues and the location of the #eidolon. Disappointed, he gifted the book to [[Norren]]. 

### Attuning to [[The Red Comet|The Exiled]] energy

After separating from the party, he spent his time peacefully meditating and attuning to the draconic energy of the [[Shards of the Exhiled]]. He was even contacted by the #eidolon himself. This was nothing new to him, so it was just a matter of time before he is able to master this energy type as well. Once he does, he tries it out and this is registered by [[Khirhan]]'s sense for powerful enemies.
