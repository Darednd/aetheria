#### Staying on the [[Valgrum Continent]]
An old settler of the [[Valgrum Continent]]. Decided to stay there instead of leave with the others, believing she can do something about the upcoming war and prevent the madness that the newly founded [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]] was bringing to the world. 

#### Marriage and Child
Eventually met [[Kleon De Hallertau]] and they fell in love. They moved to [[Valgrum]] where she continued her efforts to bring reason to the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|church]]. After some time, both of them were blessed with a child, the baby half-elf they named [[Finn]]. 

#### Recruitment
Eventually, the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|church]] got tired of her efforts to thwart their aggressive advance and blackmailed her into becoming a "slave" of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|church]]. It was either that, or the life of her child. Having no choice, she had to agree and helped them and waged war against her will to protect her son. Being a very powerful wizard, she was a great addition to both the strategizing units and frontline combatants.

#### Slave of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|Church]]
She was treated badly and without respect. Being an elf and not believing in [[Eternis]], the faithful Soldiers and Generals always mistreated her. From verbal to physical assaults, she suffered greatly, but endured for the sake of her son, [[Finn|Finn]].

#### Death
While on a mission with general [[Julius Cicero]], one night the soldiers got too drunk and tried assaulting her. She struggled, still having some pride left in her, but was not able to overpower the few soldiers trying to get their fill. This resulted in one soldier stabbing and killing her. [[Julius Cicero]] came too late. The deed was done and the sick soldiers were having their fun with her dead boy. This resulted with the [[Julius Massacre]] and the [[Julius Defection]]. This tragic event was referred to by [[Julius Cicero]] as [[Aska's Defilement]].

[[Kleon De Hallertau]] received the news of Aska's death, but of course, not of the conditions in which she died. This by itself was enough to break the old man and for him to drown his sorrows in alcohol. There was no mention of her deeds too. It was not in the interest of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|church]] for people to know that their previous successes were because of a non-human. He ultimately decides to tell [[Finn|Finn]] that his mother was a war hero and spare him some suffering.
