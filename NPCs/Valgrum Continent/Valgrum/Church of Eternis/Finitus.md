In a dire situation, [[Finn]], one of the members of [[Party 2]] was given a choice. Let the pain take over, or die.

Driven to a near-death state by [[Bal Chuvorsk]] and his #ersatzWeapon, both [[Psionus]] and [[Finn]] feared for his life. It is then that [[Psionus]] even sounding fearful, told [[Finn]] "You have to let it take over." And that he did. #residual bursting through his body, passing through [[The Far Realm|The Space Beyond]], let the parasite that was in [[Finn]]'s stomach to be unchained and with the help of [[Psionus]], unleash its power and make [[Finn]] ascend into a champion of [[Psionus|The Dreamer]]. With a bursting pillar of psychic energy, [[Finn]] stands up and walks through the other dimension into [[Valgrum]].

He walks into the [[Royal Palace]]'s main chamber where [[Abraham]] awaits him. He relinquishes his throne as being [[Psionus|The Dreamer]]'s medium, he already knows what has happened and is ecstatic. He also reaches through space and claims [[Lucidity - The Dreamer's Legendary Armament]]. [[Aeon]] enters the room and greets them. [[Finn]] sends him to the [[Party 3]] in order to search for a potential new avatar of [[Psionus]].

His first order of business is to make an appearance and that he does. Standing where once kings and queens of [[Valgrum]] stood, he shows the city the #mesmerizingColor and introduces himself as the new messiah of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]]. The people cheer and are breathtaken.

The second order of business, is [[The Purge]]...

Soon after, he will kidnap [[Anie]] and bring [[Psionus|The Dreamer]]'s plans closer to fruition, only to be sabotaged by facing off with [[Khirhan]] and [[Anie]] being freed from her safekeeping room by [[Party 3]] minus [[Aeon]].

He will later recover, but will be made aware by [[Psionus|The Dreamer]] that his body cannot go on for much longer and that he must ascend even further, by becoming a lich...
