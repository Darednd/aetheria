#### Childhood
As a kid, [[Julius Cicero]] aspired to be a soldier of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]]. He regarded the soldiers and generals with high regard and thought highly of them. His father was a soldier and died when he was very young. He was told that his father died a hero, which inspired him.

#### Adulthood and [[Esma]]
He registered in the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]] and pretty swiftly advanced through the ranks to become a General. A lot of missions later, he lead a small unit to talk to an [[Lakhâ€™ota Orc Tribe|orc tribe]]. The Orcs recklessly attacked them and after the dust had settled. All of the soldiers laid dead. All but one. [[Julius Cicero]] was barely alive and just as he was about to get killed by [[Bokhan]], the tribe's leader, [[Esma]] pleaded with him to spare him. She, being a healer, treated him and they eventually started talking. That day, he realized a few things. What they did was not okay, in fact, far from it. He learned that other races are not inherently bad and that there were many more gods than the over-God everyone on the [[Valgrum Continent]] believed in. There was such diversity that what they were doing was plain wrong. Before being violently exhiled from the tribe, he left [[Esma]] a gift, a baby waiting to see the light of day and face all the issues that come with it. She also gave him a gift, the [[Lakh'ota Battleaxe]].

#### [[Aska Sharian]] and [[Julius Defection|Defection]]
With his resolve broken and more aware of the attrocities they were comitting. He found another non-human that resonated with him. This elven mage was far smarter than him, but was pleasantly surprised to see that not everyone is a mindless slave of the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)|church]]. On a mission together, he witnessed the [[Aska's Defilement|tragic death]] of [[Aska Sharian]] by the hands of his own soldiers. Enraged, he [[Julius Massacre|killed all of them]] and returned to [[Valgrum]] alone, badly injured. There, he successfully lied about what happened and due to his injuries requested that he is dismissed, which he was.
