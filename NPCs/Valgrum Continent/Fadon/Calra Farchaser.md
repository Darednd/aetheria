Half-orc female captain of the [[Sour Pot]] ship. Potty mouth. Has a few crew members always accompanying her.

Willing to rent the [[Sour Pot]] ship or sell it for that matter (10 000gp).

Gave the [[Party]] a trip to [[Euwetax Continent]] and back. Lost a few men along the way. [[Finn]] did a really good job of persuading her to join their cause against the church, but her gut feeling told her otherwise. She does not join the [[Party]] in their quest to destroy the [[Church of the Eternal (Eternis)]].
