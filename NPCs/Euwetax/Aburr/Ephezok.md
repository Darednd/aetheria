A [Mind Flayer Arcanist](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#mind%20flayer%20arcanist_mm) in charge of the [[Aburr]] village. This benevolent aberration keeps the village safe and helps the people in whichever way he can. He is brutal to the criminals in the small village and the severe cases he turns into thralls with his [Intellect Devourers](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#intellect%20devourer_mm).

Ephezok knows about [[Psionus]]'s existence and symbol. He can also sense aberration-touched people, having a mix of normal and aberration-touched humanoids in his village.

If they examine [[Finn]] they can offer them the [[Aberrant Materials]] quest.
