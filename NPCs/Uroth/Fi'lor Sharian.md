An elf scholar, long time and way from home. After an unfortunate event, he came into contact with [[Necron]], who would feed his curiosity in exchange for sapping his life essence, making him look a lot older than he actually is. This would lead him to move to [[Nora]] where he would continue his research about vitality and immortality.

He would eventually discover [[The Abyss]] and the [[Exsanguinated Temple]] which would further spike his curiosity and he would pursue the artifacts that lay there.

Eventually, he would invent [[Warforged]] and start creating them almost serially, as in a factory. Some would rebel, like [[The Warforged Monk]] and seek their destiny, or revenge elsewhere. With [[Warforged]], he also invented [[Autognomes]], one of which was [[SF]], who was sent to the [[Exsanguinated Temple]] and with a strange inclination for death, released [[Malzeno]] by sacrificing himself. [[Fi'lor Sharian]] would not find out about this, as [[Necron]] took the pieces of this autognome, but will not share the results or implications of it, as it can potentially cause discord in their relationship if another #eidolon  joined the mix. He would receive a report from [[Callowahry]] about the outcome of the operation [[SF]] was sent on, which would again, spark his interest.

He will eventually stumble upon a [[Fragment of Thysia]] and would task a group of adventurers to bring it to [[Alaerela Continent]], [[El]], [[Par'makh Peninsula]] for research. Once he has results, he would seek the new #eidolon  in hopes of furthering his research. This will indeed cause discord with his relationship with [[Necron]] as he will realize he was lied to.

### Life in [[Nora]]

As the inventor of [[Warforged]] and [[Autognomes]], Fi'lor is living a life of luxury. The town's safety and services lie in his hands. Thanks to his creations, the streets are safe, the people are happy, he gets his funds and the power to influence and get away with, well nearly murder. His research continues undisturbed and without obstructions. The town and people live in abundance, as almost every task is automated and all for a bit of gold and blood.

His workshop is near the center of the town, where [[Rulers of Noir City]] reside. He gets help from all sorts of people including nobles, scholars, adventurers, commoners... Errands are constantly posted on a notice board near his manor with hefty rewards.

### Blood Equipment

With his desire to research the [[Exsanguinated Temple]], came new learnings and with them, new technology. Apart from the robots that he invented using this blood technology, he also developed new weapons and armor, enchanted items as well. The principle was simple and similar to the old [[Necron|The Reaper]]-based technology he previously used. The item would pierce the owner, doing some damage and sucking some of their blood. In turn, with the blood consumed, it would grant them a good jolt of power, one way or the other. Weapons become usable, or deadlier, armor becomes sturdier, capabilities people could only dream of become possible.

There is one catch though. Each pierce and ounce consumed, [[Thysia]] draws closer to awakening and surfacing. While dormant, she is still watchful and embraces all that wish to share their blood with her.
