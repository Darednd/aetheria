>Oh they've been like that since I got here... Which was 2 or 3 months ago. They rarely stop and we are already having trouble supplying enough dummies. We even tried getting sturdier ones, but they keep breaking them. I wish I had such stamina... Or determination...

		*- Resident of the [[Crossroads (Place)]]*

Originally, a creation of [[Fi'lor Sharian]] in [[Nora]], [[Uroth Continent]]. By her own will, aided by the blood used to create her - the one of [[The Legendary Monk]], she broke free from her blood-bound shackles and defected the [[Nora Guards]] and headed to [[Arax Continent]] on the first ship he could take.

On [[Arax Continent|Arax]] she searched for a place where she could only hone her skills and meditate on her existence, seeking answers from within herself. She refused offers from high-standing people in [[Anburora Maton]] and [[Aramore]], and even declined ones from the [[Arcanists]], who would have loved if she could join them. She eventually stumbles upon the [[Crossroads (Place)]] and finds her place, at least for the time being.

She spends day and night polishing her skills and meditating while doing so. Going into stasis only when absolutely necessary. A lot of people have approached her, including [[Alatriyon]] and [[Aeon]], but nobody has yet to entice her into a conversation, or a fight...
