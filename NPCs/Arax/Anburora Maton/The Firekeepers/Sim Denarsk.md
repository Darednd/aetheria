A human paladin clas in red plated armor. Lively and loud, he wants to be the center of attention and boast about his great deeds. He is the face of [[The Firekeepers]] and does most of the talking.

He is tied to [[Ignis]] and they make quite a good pair as he is very prideful with himself and his team.

The sigil of [[Ignis]] is burned into his shield, which is also an [[Aspects of Reciprocity]].
Thanks to his connection with the fire #eidolon, he is able to imbue himself with red flames, who hurt anyone who enters his melee range for 1d10 fire damage. This aura does not hurt alies.

Origin
- [[Crossroads (Place)]]

Current location - [[Anburora Maton]]
